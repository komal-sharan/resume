        <p>
            I have had the opportunity to work and grow with  diverse and innovative programmers and over a span of
            last 4 years I have learned and developed my skillsets. Currently working on my Masters thesis in Computer Science,
            I hope to show some substantial results in the field of deep learning. I am looking for a machine learning team to work with
            to start my career as a C++ developer/front end developer/ machine learning engineer in such teams as I always have been very determined to follow my dreams and passions.

                <em property="italic">Autonomous Driving Project: </em>

                <li>Created an application for a autonomous driving car based on driverâ€™s choice
                    for a research project for Tesla.</li>
                <li>Developed an application for a car cluster display (digital instrument panel)
                    for an Infotainment System using Angular JS for UI.</li>
                <li>Achieved synchronization between the head unit and cluster applications
                    using advanced concepts of AngularJS and Node.JS. Used Node.Js for the

                    data from a MongoDB database.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <em property="italic">Framework Migration</em>
                <li>Migration of applications based on two differently layered architectures in C++.
                    Three layers - the MVC layer, application logic layer and the Client handler and
                    services like GDBUS were implemented differently in the new framework
                    design.</li>
